# Telecom Operator interconnect-
About the project: The telecom operator Interconnect would like to be able to forecast their churn of clients. If it's discovered that a user is planning to leave, they will be offered promotional codes and special plan options. Interconnect's marketing team has collected some of their clientele's personal data, including information about their plans and contracts.

In this project, we are tasked to develop a machine learning model that can predict when a potentail client might cancel their phone plan with an AUC-ROC score of not less than 0.75.
As part of completing the project, one has to design a work plan which has to be reveiwed and approved by the team leader. 
Data exploration and analysis is carried out with the various files merged. 

Project summary Results:Because of the class inbalance with the target column, different sampling methods were used and the one providing better results used in addition to high performing models in the training session. Different models were used in testing the model with the highest scores of 0.91 on two of the models (XGBoost and LGBM Boosting). Monthly subscribers and does that pay using electronic checks were identified as the highest defaults.
